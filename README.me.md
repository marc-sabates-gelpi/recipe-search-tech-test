RF Search

A first version will be attempted using a hashmap index of all the 'words' (`#"[a-zA-Z]{4,}"`)
This should allow to use fast 1 word searches

A further approach will be to implement >1 words' search

Further work would need to take into account other indexing structures, e.g. Binary trees, Ternaries trees
